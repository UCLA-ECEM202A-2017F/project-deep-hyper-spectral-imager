# Deep Hyperspectral Imager

## Objective
To create  an imaging device that augments RGB cameras with additional non-imaging modalities such as RF, acoustic, depth and thermal.
Each of these modalities provide different information about the scene and the project aims to create a platform to fuse these multimodal images and train the platform for object detection.

## Specific goals:
1. Map a source of sound in 3D space by making use of beamforming micro phone arrays
2. Obtain RF, thermal and depth images of the scene
3. Calibrate the imaging sensors in a way that they cover a specific field of view in the scene.
4. Integrate the imaging sensors into a single platform
5. Train the hyperspectral imaging platform for object detection
